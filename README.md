# json-generator
Easy-to-use generator to make the JSON files for primarily resource packs, but also can be used for resource packs.

Currently in heavy development, only tab that doesn't work as of right now is recipes, but the other tabs work well.
If you find any issues, report them on the github here, and Deviouslrd will attend to it!
