# json-generator
Easy-to-use generator to make the JSON files for primarily resource packs, but also can be used for resource packs.

Currently working on a merge to Tauri, hence why it hasn't recieved any commits for multiple months. Additionally, expect bugs to exist, as it is still in its alpha stage.

If you find any issues, report them on the github here, and Deviouslrd will attend to it!
