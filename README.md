# JSON-Generator
Easy-to-use generator to make the JSON files primarily for mods, but also can be used for resource packs.

A full rewrite is in progress for this app, to improve many of its issues.

If you find any issues, report them on the github here, and Deviouslrd will attend to it!

## Local Development Fork

To edit this generator for your own purposes, theres just a couple steps.
1. Clone the repo to a local folder (easy to do with the github desktop app, or via cli)
2. Open the repo in your favourite code editor, and open a terminal of sorts.
3. Run `npm i` to install all the dependencies and to acquire the node modules required to run it.
4. When that is finished, run `npm start` or `npm run start` to run the program.
5. Enjoy the chaos that is the JSON generator. (I'm not kidding)
