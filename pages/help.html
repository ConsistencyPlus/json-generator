        <p class="helptext">
            This program is a simple way to generate all the JSON files you require for things such as mods, resource packs, and data packs!<br><br>
            In short, it works by taking the inputs you give it, and replacing the values in the JSON files.<br>

        <h2 class="helpheader">How to Use the Generator</h2>
        <p class="helptext">
            It's simple! Put the values into the boxes provided, and create JSON files!<br>
            Well, in more detail:<br><br>
            Take the Block Name input box, for example. In order to properly use it, you put the name of the block you want a JSON file in there.<br>
            It does not matter what format you use, "Example Block", "example block", and "example_block" are all viable options, as the generator will automatically convert it to the format it requires.<br><br>
            For the checkboxes, just select the boxes for the files you want created. Simple.<br>

        <h2 class="helpheader">Save Locations and File Paths</h2>
        <ul class="helptext">
            <li>If you are creating a mod (specifically fabric, I do not know the forge mod file structure for assets.), then you will want to choose the src/main/resources.</li>
            <li>If you are creating a resource pack, you want to select the folder which is the name of the pack you are making. So if you pack is named "Ye Olde Pack", you will want to select the "Ye Olde Pack" folder.</li>
            <li>If you have the folders already existing, then the mod will just use those. If anything is missing, then it will be created for you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="helptext">
            Proper support for data packs may never happen, sorry. However, the crafting section may be useful for the pack.<br>

    <div>
        <a id="textnamespace"/>
        <h2 class="helpheader">Texture Namespaces</h2>
        <p class="helptext">
            That input box is used inside the json file itself. Before you ask about the "Mod Name" box, that one is used mostly for the filepath. If the "Texture Namespace" is empty, then it's value will default to the "Mod Name" box.
        </p>

    <div>
        <a id="advancements"/>
        <h2 class="helpheader">Advancements</h2>
        <p class="helptext">
            The advancement feature in the generator is very basic. It will be expanded on later, but as of right now, all it can generate is recipe advancements.<br><br>
            To use it, just put a block name in the input box. Put another item name in the "Trigger Name" box - this is what triggers the advancement.<br><br>
            Upon picking up the trigger item, it will unlock the recipes for 4 basic blocks derived from the "Block Name" box: stairs, slabs, pillars, and walls. If you wish to add your own blocks, replace as necessary and use the pre-generated values as a template.<br>

    <div>
        <a id="recipes"/>
        <h2 class="helpheader">Recipes</h2>
        <p class="helptext">
            Recipes are currently under revamping. If you use a version which has recipes enabled, and you wish to use them, be prepared to meet a lot of bugs.<br><br>
            I suggest not using any version with recipes at all. If its enabled, leave it be. Later versions until recipes are working and properly revamped will not have them enabled.
